# Fruit Slider Background Analysis

## Current State (Observed)
Looking at the fruit slider on the homepage:
- Passion Fruit - has dark gradient container with fruit image
- Prickly Pear - has dark gradient container with fruit image  
- Green Tea Extract - has dark gradient container with leaves image
- Blueberry - has dark gradient container with fruit image
- Cherry - has dark gradient container with fruit image
- Cranberry - visible on right edge

## Issue
The user mentioned fruit images need consistent white backgrounds. Currently they appear to have:
- Dark gradient containers around each fruit
- The fruit images themselves may have varying background treatments

## Required Fix
Need to ensure all fruit images have consistent transparent/white backgrounds and the container styling is uniform across all fruits.
