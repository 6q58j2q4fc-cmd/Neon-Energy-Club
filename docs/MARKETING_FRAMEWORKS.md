# Proven Marketing Frameworks for NEON Energy Drink

## 1. AIDA Framework (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

### Implementation Strategy:

- Present unique benefits
- Use engaging statistics
- Show social proof

**Desire (Emotional Connection)**
- Paint the transformation picture
- Showcase testimonials
- Highlight exclusivity
- Create FOMO (limited availability)

**Action (Clear CTA)**
- Single, focused call-to-action
- Remove friction (minimal form fields)
- Add urgency (countdown timers)

## 2. PAS Framework (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

PAS is highly effective for conversion copywriting, especially for health/wellness products.

### Implementation Strategy:

**Problem**
- "Tired of energy drinks that leave you crashing?"
- "Struggling to stay focused without jitters?"
- "Worried about what's in your energy drink?"

**Agitate**
- Amplify the pain: "Every crash costs you productivity"
- Create urgency: "Your competitors aren't slowing down"
- Emotional trigger: "Don't let fatigue hold you back"

**Agitate**
- Introduce NEON as the answer
- Highlight natural ingredients
- Show transformation stories
