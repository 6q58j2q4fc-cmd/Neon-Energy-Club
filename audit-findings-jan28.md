# Theme Consistency & Fruit Slider Audit - Jan 28

## Fruit Slider Issues Found

Looking at the Natural Ingredients section, I can see the fruit images:
- **Passion Fruit** - Has dark/green circular background container
- **Prickly Pear** - Has dark/green circular background container  
- **Green Tea Extract** - Has dark/green circular background container
- **Blueberry** - Has dark/green circular background container
- **Cherry** - Has dark/green circular background container (image appears to have white/light background visible)
- **Cranberry** - Has dark/green circular background container

**Issue**: The fruit images themselves have inconsistent backgrounds - some appear to have white backgrounds showing through the circular container, while others blend better. The user requested all images have consistent white backgrounds.

## Theme Consistency

The homepage has the Vice City/jungle theme with:
- Neon green/yellow text
- Dark background with city skyline
- Palm tree silhouettes
- Consistent color palette

Need to audit other pages to ensure consistency.

## Vending Machine Section

The "BUILD YOUR EMPIRE" section shows vending machine but the image is broken (showing alt text "NEON AI Vending Machine" instead of actual image).

## Actions Needed

1. Fix fruit slider images - ensure all have consistent white/transparent backgrounds
2. Fix vending machine image loading issue
3. Create deposit/payment plan feature for vending machines
4. Audit all other pages for theme consistency
